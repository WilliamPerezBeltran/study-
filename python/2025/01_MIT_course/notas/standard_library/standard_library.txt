The Python Standard Library is a collection of script modules accessible to a Python
program to simplify the programming process and removing the need to rewrite commonly 
used commands. They can be used by 'calling/importing' them at the beginning of a script.

A list of the Standard Library modules can be found at http://www.python.org/doc/.

The following are among the most important:

- time
- sys
- os
- math
- random
- pickle
- urllib
- re
- cgi
- socket
