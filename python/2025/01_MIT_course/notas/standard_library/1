The Python Standard Library is a collection of script modules accessible to a Python
program to simplify the programming process and removing the need to rewrite commonly 
used commands. They can be used by 'calling/importing' them at the beginning of a script.

A list of the Standard Library modules can be found at http://www.python.org/doc/.

The following are among the most important:

- time
- sys
- os
- math
- random
- pickle
- urllib
- re
- cgi
- socket
- itertools
- urllib
- collections



1. Operating system & file management

	os 
	sys 
	pathlib 
	shutil 
	glob 
	tempfile 
	fileinput 
	fnmatch 
	stat 
	errno

2. Data types & structures

collections, heapq, bisect, array, queue, struct, enum, types, weakref

3. Math & numbers

math, cmath, decimal, fractions, random, statistics, numbers, math

4. Strings & text

string, re, textwrap, unicodedata, difflib, codecs, formatter

5. File formats & data serialization

json, csv, xml, plistlib, pickle, shelve, configparser, marshal

6. Networking & internet

socket, ssl, http, urllib, ftplib, poplib, imaplib, smtplib, asyncio, cgi

7. Date & time

time, datetime, calendar, zoneinfo, sched

8. System & process management

logging, traceback, warnings, argparse, inspect, subprocess, resource, atexit, getpass

9. Concurrency & parallelism

threading, multiprocessing, queue, asyncio, concurrent.futures, sched

10. Development & debugging

pdb, doctest, unittest, cProfile, profile, timeit, trace

11. Compression & archiving

zlib, gzip, bz2, lzma, zipfile, tarfile

12. Cryptography & security

hashlib, hmac, secrets, ssl, getpass

This is most of the commonly used standard library. There are some more niche ones, but these cover the vast majority of tasks.

If you want, I can make a super short “cheat sheet” with just 20–30 modules that are the most important to know for everyday Python. That’s very practical to memorize. Do you want me to do that?
