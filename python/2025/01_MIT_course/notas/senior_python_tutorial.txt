Senior Python 3 Tutorial
1. Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms
Explore heaps, tries, balanced trees, and graph algorithms.

Practice implementing and using these data structures efficiently.

2. Decorators and Metaclasses
Learn how decorators modify functions or methods.

Understand metaclasses to customize class creation.

3. Concurrency and Parallelism
Use threading and multiprocessing modules.

Explore asynchronous programming with asyncio and await.

Build scalable, non-blocking applications.

4. Memory Management and Profiling
Study Python memory model and garbage collection.

Use profiling tools (cProfile, memory_profiler) to detect bottlenecks.

5. Generators and Iterators
Write custom iterators and generators for lazy evaluation.

Use yield for efficient looping.

6. Context Managers
Create context managers with the with statement.

Implement using __enter__ and __exit__ or contextlib.

7. Functional Programming
Use lambda functions, map(), filter(), reduce().

Understand immutability and higher-order functions.

8. Error Handling and Logging
Implement robust try-except-finally blocks.

Use Pythonâ€™s logging module for scalable logging solutions.

9. Testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Write unit tests with unittest or pytest.

Apply TDD cycles to improve code quality.

10. Type Hinting and Static Analysis
Annotate functions with type hints.

Use mypy or pyright for type checking.

11. Design Patterns and Best Practices
Study common patterns: Singleton, Factory, Observer, etc.

Follow PEP 8 for code style and write clean, maintainable code.

12. Advanced OOP Concepts
Deep dive into inheritance, polymorphism.

Manage multiple inheritance and data encapsulation.

13. Asynchronous Programming
Write async functions with async def.

Use event loops and async libraries like aiohttp.

14. Regular Expressions
Master regex syntax and Python re module for text parsing.

15. Packaging and Deployment
Create Python packages and manage dependencies.

Use virtual environments, Docker, and deploy on cloud platforms.

16. Interfacing with C/C++ Code
Use ctypes or Cython to optimize performance-heavy parts.

17. Security Best Practices
Secure coding practices.

Manage credentials safely and avoid vulnerabilities.
