First know the history of python. And follow this tips:

	1.Know the key difference between python2 and python3 such as what syntax were included 
		and what key module had diffrent functions or new functions were added.
		 
	2. Learn the lists and tuples and dictionary as they are basics and sometimes interviewer 
		asks questions from them and people are not prepared for them so it makes a bad impression on them.

	3.List methods(especially ways to reverse them)
	4.List slicing(learn how to concatenate two strings while deleting 
		a specific position of a string)

	5.Dictionary(how to transfer a list as keys and how to transform 
		another list as keys in dictionary)
		
	6.Uses of sets/forzensets(especially learn forzensets as its method 
		usually slips from mind, sometimes when you dont use it)

	7.Loops(and learn how to print pascals triangle)
	8.File I/O
	9.Functions and classes
	10.What is args/keywds

	11. Built-in-functions(lists,dictionaries are must to know)

	12. debugging and error-handling(try….except)

	13. regex module in python is also a must know as in python3 it has an additional functions

	14.list & dictionary comprehension

	15.Learn map,lambda,filter,reduce

	16.Iterator
	17.Generator
	18.Decorator
	19.Object Oriented Programming
	20.Inheritance
	21.Polymorphism
	22.Abstraction
	23.Encapsulation
	24.Duck typing
	25.classmethod and staticmethod
	26.deepcopy vs shallow copy
	27.External Modules

Practice 1–15 atleast for base and from their onwards the python language becomes complex as their logic gets harder to keep in mind that when sitting in interview never to get nervous as it looks that you are uprepared and sometimes some things may slip your mind as logics can only be done with a calm mind.
