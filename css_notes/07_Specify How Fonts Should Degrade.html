				Now you can use the Lobster font in your CSS by using Lobster as the FAMILY_NAME as in the following example:
				font-family: FAMILY_NAME, GENERIC_NAME;.

				The GENERIC_NAME is optional, and is a fallback font in case the other specified font is not available. This is covered in the next challenge.

				Family names are case-sensitive and need to be wrapped in quotes if there is a space in the name. For example, you need quotes to use the "Open Sans" font, but not to use the Lobster font.
